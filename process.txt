Imported rospy, sensor_msg and numpy

Defined the frequency of data generation as 10 Hz.

Initialised acceleration and gyro as numpy arrays. Notice the 2nd entry in the acceleration array is 9.8 which will remain constant.

Created a publisher which publishes to the topic imu/data

Created an integer K, initialised it to 0, this will be used to smoothly increase the data.

In the while loop we put conditions so that it runs for 10 seconds

Then on every interation we increment the value of both acceleration and gyro by 0.001

Then we create the imu message and populate it with data of linear acceleration and velocity.

Finally we publish the imu message

Then we run rostopic echo <name of topic> to show the imu data generated in ROS message format.
